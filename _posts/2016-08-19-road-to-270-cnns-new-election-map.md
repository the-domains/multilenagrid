  The former secretary of state has been able to ride a post-convention bounce
  and mostly uncontested television airwaves to her strongest position yet in
  CNN's Electoral College outlook this year. This election is far from over, but
  the map now -- which is a snapshot of this moment and not a prediction -- more
  solidly favors Clinton.
